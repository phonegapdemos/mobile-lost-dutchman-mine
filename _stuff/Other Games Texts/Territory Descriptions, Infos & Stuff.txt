Territory: the Mountain Men is about exploring and trading with Indian tribes in the early 19th century.  You establish a trading post where the Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers join.  In the next 15 years your goal is to become the richest fur trader in the territory and to beat the rival traders operating in the area. To accomplish this you will have to battle natives, grizzlies and wolves and search out mountain passes and natural wonders.

It's 1815. You are young and adventurous and your goal is to become rich
and famous. You set out to make your fortune in the Upper Missouri region
of the Louisiana Purchase, recently acquired from France by President Jefferson.
In St. Louis you have heard tales of the success of companies like John Jacob Astor's
American Fur Co, Manuel Lisa's Missouri Fur Co. and the Hudson Bay Co.

In the town taverns you have listened to the mountain men who have returned with bales
of fur. They tell glowing tales of the bountiful land to the West where there is plentiful
beaver for trapping and the native tribes are eager to trade pelts for firewater, weapons,
copper pots, beads, trade tomahawks and other goods.

There is an insatiable market in Europe for beaver pelts. European gentlemen want fine hats 
and a beaver felt hat is considered extremely valuable. But the beaver has been extinct in
Europe since the 16th century.

With borrowed money,you set up the Rocky Mountain Fur Company, determined to
become the richest citizen of the new territories. You hire an agent to handle the
bookwork and requisitions in St. Louis and, with a trapper companion and trade goods,
you set off to make your fortune in the new territories.
